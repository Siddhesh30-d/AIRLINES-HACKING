# AIRLINES-HACKING
A Python-based tool that scans local Wi-Fi networks to detect connected devices and test network segmentation, especially in in-flight environments. It uses ARP scanning to identify IP and MAC addresses, helping evaluate security and isolation between users. Includes real scan mode, demo simulation, and log-saving for analysis.
